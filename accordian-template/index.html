                    Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, boosts mood, enhances energy levels, and helps
                    maintain a healthy weight. It also strengthens bones and muscles, reduces the risk of chronic
                    diseases, and can improve mental health by reducing anxiety and depression.

                    salt. Hydration is also important, so drink plenty of water.
